/*!
 * \brief The FRIJointOverlayClient class
 * Derives from LBRClient to implement real-time functionalities.
 * Implements virtual onStateChange, functions monitor, waitForCommand and command from LBRClient.
 *
 * The Overlay Client is setup so that the queue keeps the last reference joint data even when
 * no information is received from the joint controller.
 *
 * This intermediate queue object is needed for two reasons.
 * 1) as a concurrent access buffer for the joint controller to send data, and to send that data
 * to the KUKA controller;
 * 2) as a mechanism to keep the last sent joint data so that the robot stays immobile even when
 * no new reference positions are being sent.
 *
 * About the last point, I tried shifting to a:
 *      robotCommand().setJointPosition(robotState().getIpoJointPosition())
 * This causes the robot so suddently jump to first joint positions received from the joint controller
 * at the end of any movement (when Persistent buffer is empty).
 *
 * I also tried shifting to a:
 *      robotCommand().setJointPosition(robotState().getCommandedJointPosition())
 * Which no longer jumps to the first position as the motion ends, but, if we continuously set the
 * joint positions to the later, the robot will slowly drift away as the set positions are not static
 * and change with slight errors.
 *
 * It is important to refer that any of these methods do not cause the robot to jump to the last FRI
 * sent position after switching to any other control mode (Hands-on, Position Control KUKA Controller).
 *
 * To cope with these problems, the Persistent buffer that stores the commanded joint positions is
 * continuously used to set the joint reference points, even after switching modes.
 * It keeps the last received set of positions, which prevents the robot from drifting away.
 * Also, since we update these positions any time we switch to COMMANDING_WAIT mode (from any other control
 * mode) with the current measured positions, we prevent to robot from jumping to the last stored
 * coordinates.
