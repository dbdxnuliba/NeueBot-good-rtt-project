	<!-- JOINT_MOTION_PROPERTIES
		Stores information about the joint motion.
		Namely  joint velocity, acceleration and jerk limits.
		Information is stored equally for all joints, consider
		using a different value for each joint. 

		Stores two values for maximum joint motion limits:
			- Free motion (Free): or PTP motion, where the robot moves from A to B 
				without regarding trajectories. Only initial and final points 
				matter. Smooth and predictable motions.

			- Trajectory Following motion (TF): or MTP motion, where to robot follows
				a pre-defined set of joint positions with the associated time law.
				Involves higher accelerations to keep up with required tasks.
