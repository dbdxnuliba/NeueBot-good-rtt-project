		end-effector to the probe end-effector, without risking being obstructed by the patient.

		(!!! THIS VALUE MUST MATCH THE TOOL_PROPERTIES FILE !!!)
		This probe should initially be placed at 30mm from the target. Add that to the length of
		currently used probe (103), thus the probe distance should be 133mm from the target point.

		This distance is set up so it allows the robot to move towards this position without risking
		entering the patient's space. After reaching the safe distance position, the robot moves
		linearly accross the required positions.
